tvOS-cipherwallet is a sample, yet fully functional tvOS application intended to demonstrate
the capabilities of a tvOS application that can collect data and perform user logins, by just
scanning a QR code on the TV screen. You can eliminate painful typing processes using the 
remote control, and easily integrate payments, registrations and logins in your tvOS app.

The tvOS-cipherwallet app acts as a browser front end for the https://demo.cipherwallet.com 
website. In a customer implementation, the cipherwallet API at demo.cipherwallet.com would be 
replaced with an API running on one of your backend servers. There are several SDK that you 
can use to speed up the integration:
    -  https://github.com/drivefast/pycipherwallet
    -  https://github.com/drivefast/node-cipherwallet
    -  https://github.com/drivefast/php-cipherwallet
You would also need to create an account on the cipherwallet website, and define the services 
that you want to offer, and the data they collect. You can find a full description of the 
cipherwallet services at https://www.cipherwallet.com/docs.html 

Regarding the tvOS implementation, you would need to add the Cipherwallet class to your 
project (fully contained in the Cipherwallet.h and .m files). Then follow the examples on 
the project's view controllers to create instances of the Cipherwallet class, and interpret 
the results coming from your API once the user scans the QR code.
